This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: not specifying a working directory.  The initial `Dockerfile` results in the application failing to run due to the incorrect location of the application files. The `Dockerfile.fixed` version addresses the issue, providing a corrected and working example.  The problem arises from using relative paths that are interpreted relative to the root of the Docker image, rather than the location of the application files. This is particularly problematic when copying files and executing commands within the container. The solution involves explicitly setting a working directory using the `WORKDIR` instruction.
